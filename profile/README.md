## About Epicalable
Epicalable was created on 2019 primarily as a youtube gaming channel. Soon the small scale startup moved into the coding world and established a base in github to post free, open-source repositories for the world to see. Our aim is to create ambitious and innovative projects. We have worked on a very few small-scaled projects so far with a constant hope that we can help the world in a small positive way.
